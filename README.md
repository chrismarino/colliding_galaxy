MathLab probability calc
### Prompt
This is a MATLAB project. Write the code that calculates the probabilyt of two stars colliding from two different gallasies when their gallaxies pass through each other.

Assume there are 1,000,000 stars in galaxy A with an average  radius of 1,000,000 miles, and there are 2,000,000 starts in  galaxy B and the average radius is 2,000,000 miles. 

Each galasy has a volume of 4.5x10^21 cubic light years.
### Response
The probability of two stars colliding can be calculated using the formula:

P = n * (Ï€ * d^2 * v) / V

where:
- n is the number of stars in the other galaxy,
- d is the diameter of a star,
- v is the relative velocity of the two galaxies, and
- V is the volume of the galaxy.

However, we don't have the relative velocity of the two galaxies in your problem. Assuming the relative velocity is not zero, we can calculate the probability of a star from galaxy A colliding with a star from galaxy B, and vice versa.

Also, we need to convert the radius of the stars from miles to light years. The conversion factor is 1 mile = 1.0570e-13 light years.

Here is the MATLAB code:

```matlab
% Constants
radius_A = 1e6; % miles
radius_B = 2e6; % miles
num_stars_A = 1e6;
num_stars_B = 2e6;
volume_galaxy = 4.5e21; % cubic light years
mile_to_ly = 1.0570e-13; % light years

% Convert radius to light years
radius_A = radius_A * mile_to_ly;
radius_B = radius_B * mile_to_ly;

% Calculate diameter
diameter_A = 2 * radius_A;
diameter_B = 2 * radius_B;

% Calculate probability
P_A = num_stars_B * (pi * diameter_A^2) / volume_galaxy;
P_B = num_stars_A * (pi * diameter_B^2) / volume_galaxy;

% Display results
fprintf('Probability of a star from galaxy A colliding with a star from galaxy B: %e\n', P_A);
fprintf('Probability of a star from galaxy B colliding with a star from galaxy A: %e\n', P_B);
```

This code calculates the probability of a star from galaxy A colliding with a star from galaxy B, and vice versa. The results are displayed in scientific notation.
### Prompt
Write the code that calcuates how long it will take until two stars collide
### Response
The time until two stars collide can be calculated using the formula:

t = d / v

where:
- d is the distance between the two stars, and
- v is the relative velocity of the two stars.

However, we don't have the distance between the two stars or their relative velocity in your problem. Assuming we have these values, we can calculate the time until the two stars collide.

Here is the MATLAB code:

```matlab
% Constants
distance = ...; % light years
velocity = ...; % light years per year

% Calculate time until collision
time_until_collision = distance / velocity;

% Display result
fprintf('Time until two stars collide: %f years\n', time_until_collision);
```

Please replace the `...` with the actual values for the distance and velocity. The result is displayed in years.
```matlab
% Constants
distance = ...; % light years
velocity = ...; % light years per year

% Calculate time until collision
time_until_collision = distance / velocity;

% Display result
fprintf('Time until two stars collide: %f years\n', time_until_collision);
```

Please replace the ... with the actual values for the distance and velocity. The result is displayed in years.

### Prompt
Using the probabilty calculation, and assuming the stars that collide are at the center of each galaxy and the galaxy are 100,000 light years apart, and travel toward each other at 1,500,000 miles per hour.
### Response
Given the distance between the galaxies and their relative velocity, we can calculate the time it will take for the galaxies to collide. Then, using the previously calculated collision probabilities, we can estimate the number of star collisions.

First, we need to convert the relative velocity from miles per hour to light years per year. The conversion factor is 1 mph = 1.467e-9 light years per year.

Here is the MATLAB code:
```matlab
% Constants
distance = 1e5; % light years
velocity_mph = 1.5e6; % miles per hour
mph_to_ly_per_year = 1.467e-9; % light years per year

% Convert velocity to light years per year
velocity = velocity_mph * mph_to_ly_per_year;

% Calculate time until galaxies collide
time_until_collision = distance / velocity;

% Calculate number of star collisions
num_collisions_A = P_A * time_until_collision;
num_collisions_B = P_B * time_until_collision;

% Display results
fprintf('Time until galaxies collide: %f years\n', time_until_collision);
fprintf('Number of star collisions from galaxy A: %e\n', num_collisions_A);
fprintf('Number of star collisions from galaxy B: %e\n', num_collisions_B);
```

Please replace P_A and P_B with the collision probabilities calculated earlier. The results are displayed in years and in scientific notation, respectively.
